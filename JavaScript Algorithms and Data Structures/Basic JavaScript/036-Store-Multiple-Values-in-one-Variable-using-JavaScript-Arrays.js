// Example
var ourArray = ["John", 23];

// Only change code below this line.
var myArray = [];
myArray = ["GeekyOrion", "28"];     // solution

/**
 * Array is used to store the mutliple value in a single variable.
 * Nomally we use array to store homogeneous values (similar kind / data-types of values)
 * Unlike C and C++, we can store heterogeneous value (different kind / data-types of values) too
 *
 * To store the values in an array wrap the values in brackets in comma seprated format
 * ex:
 *      var arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, "string-too", function fun() {console.log("this is a function");}, new Object("name": "GeekyOrion")];
 *
 * whatever we want to store, we can store in the array.
 *
 * Note:    1) In C and C++, we use struct and union to create heterogeneous type of array
 *          2) In python also, we can store the any kind of data in an array in the same way as JS
