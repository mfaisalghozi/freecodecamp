// Example
var ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
var ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";

// Only change code below this line

// solution starts here ---------------------

var myName = "Shashank";
var myStr = "My name is " + myName + " and I am well!";

// --------------------- solution ends here

/**
 * Ofcourse we can also insert a variable to concat the string
 *
 * We can use backticks (`) [ES6 ways] to construct the string
 * ex:
 *      var myStr = `My name is ${myName} and I am well!`;
 *
 * Here inside the ${---} we can interpolate expression, mathematical operation, variable, etc
 *
 * [
 *      Any python learner
 *      [Code]
 *          myName = "Shashank"
 *          print(f"My name is {myName} and I am well!")
 *      [/Code]
 *
 *      missing semicolon ;     <<--- don't required in JS and python both
