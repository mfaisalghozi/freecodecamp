// Example
var ourStr = "I come first. " + "I come second.";

// Only change code below this line

var myStr;
myStr = "This is the start. " + "This is the end.";     // solution

/**
 * Plus can be used to join (concat) two or more strings
 * '+' won't introduce any space in between the string so provide space as per use
 *
 * ex:
 *      1) "Geeky" + "Orion"    output --->> "GeekyOrion"
 *      2) "Geeky " + "Orion"   output --->> "Geeky Orion"
