// var myStr = ""; // Change this line

var myStr = "I am a \"double quoted\" string inside \"double quotes\".";    // solution

/**
 * We can use escape sequence to use double quote inside a string
 * which is quoted using double quotes
 *
 * backslash (\) used to escape (ignore) the default behaviour or
 * purpose of single or double quote i.e. "considering it as an end of string"
 *
 * ex:
 *      "I am a \"double quoted\" string inside \"double quotes\"."
 *      will be rendered as:
 *      I am a "double quoted" string inside "double quotes".
 *
 * To get a strong idea about escape sequences see 024-Escape-Sequences-in-Strings.js
