// Example
var ourStr = "I come first. ";
ourStr += "I come second.";

// Only change code below this line

// solution starts here ---------------------

var myStr;
myStr = "This is the first sentence. ";
myStr += "This is the second sentence.";

// --------------------- solution ends here

/**
 * myStr += "string";    is same as      myStr = myStr + string;
 *
 * In case of '+=' or '+', we need to take care of space while concatenating
